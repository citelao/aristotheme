# The Aristocats Wordpress Template

License is proprietary because I don't want to take the time to find one.

## Install

Typically run a `npm install` and a `bower install`. Your Wordpress needs the Meta Box plugin (metabox.io) and Simple Page Sidebars (wordpress.org/plugins/simple-page-sidebars). Just install them in the WP dashboard.

## Building

`gulp` or `gulp serve` will compile the theme into `dist/`. I usually symlink that to my `wp-content/themes/` folder.
